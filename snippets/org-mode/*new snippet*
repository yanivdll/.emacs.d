Hey $1,

Thanks for the interest in joining Baby Weatr Beta!

Translating weather forecast to baby's outfite is always a challange, especially in this freezing weather. Baby Weatr's goal is to help make parents' life easier by suggesting a baby outfit based on weather conditions, as well as the baby's gender. I hope you'll find it helpful!
