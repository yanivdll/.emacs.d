Thanks for sending it over Eva. I can't tell if the content from those publishers is promoted or not, because most big publishers are also buying traffic on our platform. Regardless, as I recall, you should be getting only promoted content, so I'll check to make sure that that's how things are configured on our end.

The way to tell whether a recommendation is paid, though, is throught the returend JSON. Look for the 'item.promoted' attribute. For promoted content, the value of this attribute will be 'true'.
