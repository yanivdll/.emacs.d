I'v started to learn touch typing. It's embarrassing to admit that I still haven't learned it, given the amount of time I spend on a keyboard everyday. But anyway, better to do it later than never.

My goals in learning touch typing are 1) to become more efficient and proficient with
my writing and 2) to reduce friction in my thought process. I want to be able to
capture thoughts as soon and as they appear, and as accurately as possible.

My main KPIs in measuring my progress are speed and accuracy. I use an app, called typist, to walk me through the learning, and this app monitor those two KPIs for me.

Initially, everything went fine. I advanced through the exercises quickly,
and felt that I typing faster and more accurately. I thought it will take no time
before I master the new skill. But then this encouraging trend flipped. My improvement stagnated, plateaued, and went backwards. Soon, I typed worst that I did before starting the exercises.

Not knowing how this can happen, I decided to secrify speed and focus on accuracy, thinking that once I type fluently it will be easier to pick up speed. This didn't work. I spent hours trying to type the same paragraph of text, over
and over again, as slow as I possibly can, but I just couldn't complete it
without making any mistake.

That's a precise articulation of what I felt - my conscious attempts to avoid
mistakes was also the sole contributor to them. It's like I knew a mistake is
imminent, and thus imminent it became.

As writing this, I'm still learning, and fighting my anticipation of mistypings. But I did modified my strategy to help me in crossing this chasm. Instead of focusing at an entire paragraph, I'm now trying to concentrate on only one word at a time, absorb this word, touch type it, return my fingers to the home row, move my attention to the next word, and repeat. This new routine improved my accuracy, and more redressed my anxious waiting for a mistake to happen. 

This experience and that pattern aren't new to me. I expereinced them many times before when learning various new skills. When I got to the US and english I thought my english was excellent, but as it turned my main language and I got absorbed in it, I realized how , I felt I 

soon felt that I talk  such as wave surfing, second language and writing. I learned that training, repetition, determination and persistency are essential to improve and make progress. Yet, at times those exact qualities hold me back and hinder improvment. As I get better at a given skill, I become more aware and sensitive to my mistakes. I find that I do things wrong more often then before, and I slowly loose confidence, and do even more mistakes than I did before. The trick is to find a way out of this vicious cycle, and gain my confidence back. When I do, learning curve starts improving fast and
