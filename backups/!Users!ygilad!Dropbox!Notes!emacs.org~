- How do I change font size?
- How do I install mode support, markdown and task paper for start?
- How can I see writing statistics?
- Hmm, some interesting commands that I find in the menu. Complete word, wonder what it does. Let's try. I did, and I don't fully understand what it should do, or how it does it. I gave up for now. Tools is the second (or lowere) priority.
