Hey Brian\Joe,

I was about to answer Joe on another thread. From what I understand, you try to create an infinite scroll, or lazy loading of additional recommendations, and get duplicate recommendations in subsequence calls. To avoid duplicate recommendations, you should use the contextID, rather than an offset parameter. 

Every responds with recommendations include a contextID attribure. If you pass this contextID as a parameter for following requests, we will treat those calls as part of the same page\session, and make sure to filter recommenationst that were served on previous calls with carrying the same contextID.

See this JSON respond for example:

So if for example the first respond has "contextId: d421c0813f8967a95a5bb10b653e2b94-idx-1", subsequent request will look something like:

https://sphere-dev.outbrain.com/api/v1/recommendations/documents?limit=10&contextid=d421c0813f8967a95a5bb10b653e2b94-idx-1

Further explanation is also available in our documentation, under the "Call Parameters" section. Let me know if it solves the errors you've experienced.
